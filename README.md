# 🌦️ Weather Bot Agent Team

A multi-agent Weather Bot built with the Agent Development Kit (ADK), designed to demonstrate core principles of building advanced LLM-powered applications using Python.

## 🚀 Overview

This project follows through the step-by-step construction of a Weather Bot system that evolves from a simple weather-fetching agent into a sophisticated multi-agent team. By the end, it'll be capable of:
- Providing real-time weather updates
- Offering polite greetings and farewells
- Remembering previously requested locations
- Delegating tasks to the right sub-agent
- Running across different LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet)
- Applying custom safety guardrails

## 🧠 What is [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/)?

ADK (Agent Development Kit) is a Python framework for building agentic applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides powerful abstractions for:
- Tool creation and usage
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Memory and state management
- LLM interoperability
- Safety via callbacks

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Tool Definition & Usage**: Give agents real-world abilities through Python functions.
- ✅ **Multi-LLM Integration**: Seamlessly switch between Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude, etc., using LiteLLM.
- ✅ **Agent Delegation**: Route user input to the most capable sub-agent.
- ✅ **Persistent Session State**: Enable memory across conversations.
- ✅ **Safety Guardrails**: Inspect and control LLM and tool usage via callbacks.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **ADK**
- **LiteLLM**
- **LLM APIs** (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
